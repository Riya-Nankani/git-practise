############################ USING PR(PULL REQUEST) NOTES  ################################
PART 2: Branching → PR → Review (NO FORK YET)

We’ll first do this on your own repo so concepts are crystal clear.
Then we’ll do fork-based flow (industry standard).

--> STEP 1️ Create a Feature Branch (LOCAL)
Inside your repo:
git branch

You should see:
* main

Now create a feature branch:
git checkout -b feature/add-git-notes

Check:
git branch

Output:
* feature/add-git-notes
  main


✅ You are now on a feature branch

--> STEP 2️ Make Changes on Feature Branch
Edit README.md (use Notepad / VS Code):
Add:
### Git Commands
- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git push

Save file.

Now:
git status
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added basic git commands notes"

--> STEP 3️ Push Feature Branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/add-git-notes

--> STEP 4️ Create Pull Request (PR)
On GitHub:
Open your repo
You’ll see “Compare & Pull Request”
Click it

OR manually:

Base: main
Compare: feature/add-git-notes

Fill PR:
Title: Add git command notes
Description: Added basic git commands for learning
Click Create Pull Request

--> STEP 5️ Review & Merge PR
Since you own the repo:
Scroll down
Click Merge Pull Request
Confirm merge

🎉 Code is now merged into main

--> STEP 6️ Sync Local Main Branch
After merge, your local main is outdated.
git checkout main
git pull origin main


Now:
git log --oneline


You’ll see merged commit.
